# Predicting-Used-Car-Prices-with-Machine-Learning

📜 Project Description
This project presents a Car Price Prediction Model that utilizes machine learning techniques to estimate the fair market value of used cars based on attributes such as mileage, engine volume, car age, and body type. The model is implemented using R, and an interactive R Shiny web application allows users to input car specifications and obtain price predictions.
The project employs Linear Regression and Decision Tree models to analyze and predict car prices, offering valuable insights for car buyers, sellers, and dealerships.

🚀 Features
1 Data Cleaning & Transformation: Handling missing values, outlier detection, and categorical encoding.
2 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Scatter plots, correlation matrices, and visual insights into price determinants.
3 Machine Learning Models: Implements Linear Regression and Decision Tree for price prediction.
4 R Shiny Web App: Interactive UI for real-time price estimation.
5 User Inputs: Allows users to select car model, year, mileage, and engine volume to get an estimated price.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Programming Language: R
Libraries:
 - tidyverse (Data Manipulation & Visualization)
 - rpart.plot (Decision Tree Visualization)
 - randomForest (Machine Learning)

📈 Model Insights
🔹 Linear Regression: Provides interpretable and stable price predictions.
🔹 Decision Tree: Captures non-linear relationships between features.
🔹 Outlier Handling: Uses z-score method to filter extreme values for accurate predictions.
🔹 Feature Engineering: Car age is calculated dynamically from the year of manufacture.
